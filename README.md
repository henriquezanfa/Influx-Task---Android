# Influx-Task---Android
Repository for Influx task

## Tecnologies
- MVVM Pattern
- Kotlin Language
- Retrofit for http requests
- Picasso for loading images


## Improvements
- I haven't succeed on set the recycler view for the Bottom Sheet.
- On the lauch I should put somthing to wait the first request to show the UI and some dialog if there are some error on the request
- I've not covered tests yet
- None of the top buttons are setted, mainly because I didn't got it's goals
